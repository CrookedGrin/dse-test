## About Cards

A c360-card is used to apply a stylized container around a grouping of information. The information could be a single item or a group of items such as a related list.

A c360-card can contain a title, optional image, body, and CTA button. Body content can be plain text or HTML.

By default, cards will expand to fill their container. In the example above, the container has a 400px max width.

The optional image maintains a 4:3 aspect ratio.
